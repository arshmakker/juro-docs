# Introducing Juro - AI-Powered Compliance Scanning

We're excited to announce the launch of Juro, a revolutionary AI-powered compliance scanning platform that makes regulatory compliance accessible to every development team.

<!--truncate-->

## The Problem

Compliance scanning has traditionally been a complex, time-consuming process that requires specialized knowledge and expensive tools. Development teams often struggle with:

- **Manual Compliance Checks**: Time-consuming manual reviews of code for regulatory violations
- **Complex Tooling**: Expensive, hard-to-use compliance scanning tools
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Lack of expertise in various compliance standards (GDPR, SOC 2, OWASP)
- **Integration Challenges**: Difficult integration with existing development workflows

## The Solution

Juro leverages the power of artificial intelligence and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide:

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**
- Natural language queries about your code's compliance
- Intelligent violation detection with context-aware suggestions
- Learning system that adapts to your codebase patterns

### üîå **Seamless Integration**
- Works with your favorite AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor)
- GitHub Actions integration for automated CI/CD scanning
- CLI tools for local development
- IDE extensions for real-time feedback

### üìä **Comprehensive Coverage**
- **20+ Programming Languages**: TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, and more
- **Multiple Regulations**: GDPR, SOC 2, OWASP Top 10, ISO 27001, WCAG
- **Real-Time Scanning**: Instant feedback as you code

## Key Features

### Natural Language Interface

Ask questions about your code in plain English:

```bash
juro ask "Does my authentication system comply with GDPR requirements?"
juro ask "Are there any SQL injection vulnerabilities in my database queries?"
juro ask "How can I improve the security of my user data handling?"
```

### Automated Compliance Scanning

```bash
# Scan for GDPR compliance
juro scan --path ./my-project --rules gdpr

# Scan for multiple standards
juro scan --path ./my-project --rules gdpr,soc2,owasp --format json
```

### Real-Time IDE Integration

Get instant compliance feedback directly in your IDE:

- **VS Code Extension**: Real-time violation highlighting
- **IntelliJ Plugin**: Integrated compliance analysis
- **Sublime Text**: Command palette integration

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Juro CLI

```bash
npm install -g @juro/cli
```

### 2. Configure Your API Key

```bash
juro config set api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### 3. Scan Your Project

```bash
juro scan --path ./my-project --rules gdpr
```

### 4. Ask Questions

```bash
juro ask "Check my code for GDPR compliance issues"
```

## Use Cases

### GDPR Compliance

Ensure your application handles personal data in compliance with GDPR:

- Data minimization checks
- Consent mechanism validation
- Data encryption verification
- Right to be forgotten implementation

### SOC 2 Compliance

Meet SOC 2 requirements for security, availability, and confidentiality:

- Access control validation
- Data encryption checks
- Audit logging verification
- Incident response procedures

### OWASP Security

Protect against the OWASP Top 10 security risks:

- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Authentication bypass detection
- Insecure direct object reference checks

## Success Stories

### TechCorp Inc.

> "Juro helped us achieve SOC 2 compliance 3x faster than traditional methods. The AI insights were game-changing." - Sarah Johnson, CTO

### StartupXYZ

> "The natural language interface made compliance accessible to our entire team. We caught issues before they became problems." - Mike Chen, Lead Developer

## What's Next

We're just getting started! Here's what's coming:

- **Additional Regulations**: HIPAA, PCI DSS, and more
- **Advanced AI Features**: Custom rule generation, predictive compliance
- **Enterprise Features**: Team management, advanced reporting, SSO integration
