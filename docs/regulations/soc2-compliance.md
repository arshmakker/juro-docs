# SOC 2 Compliance

Learn how to ensure your code meets SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) requirements.

## Trust Service Criteria

### Security

- Access controls
- System monitoring
- Incident response
- Data encryption

### Availability

- System uptime
- Performance monitoring
- Disaster recovery
- Business continuity

### Processing Integrity

- Data accuracy
- Processing completeness
- System reliability
- Error handling

### Confidentiality

- Data protection
- Access restrictions
- Encryption
- Secure transmission

### Privacy

- Data collection
- Data use
- Data retention
- Data disposal

## Common Violations

### Security

- Weak authentication
- Inadequate access controls
- Missing encryption
- Poor incident response

### Availability

- Single points of failure
- Inadequate monitoring
- Missing disaster recovery
- Poor performance

### Processing Integrity

- Data validation issues
- Incomplete processing
- System errors
- Poor error handling

## Best Practices

### Security Implementation

```javascript
// Good: Strong authentication
const auth = await authenticate(user, {
  multiFactor: true,
  sessionTimeout: 3600000
});

// Bad: Weak authentication
const auth = await authenticate(user); // No additional security
```

### Access Controls

```javascript
// Good: Role-based access
const hasAccess = await checkAccess(user, resource, 'read');

// Bad: No access control
const data = await getData(); // No access check
```

### Data Encryption

```javascript
// Good: Encrypted data
const encryptedData = await encrypt(data, {
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
  key: process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY
});

// Bad: Unencrypted data
const data = await getData(); // No encryption
```

## Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Security controls are implemented
- [ ] Access controls are adequate
- [ ] System monitoring is in place
- [ ] Incident response procedures exist
- [ ] Data encryption is implemented
- [ ] Disaster recovery plans exist
- [ ] Regular security audits are conducted
