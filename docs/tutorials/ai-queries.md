# AI Queries Tutorial

Learn how to use Juro's AI-powered natural language queries to analyze your code's compliance. Ask questions about your code in plain English and get intelligent, context-aware answers.

## Prerequisites

- Juro CLI installed (`npm install -g @juro/cli`)
- API key configured (`juro config set api-key YOUR_API_KEY`)
- A project to analyze

## Basic AI Queries

### 1. Simple Compliance Questions

Ask basic questions about your code's compliance:

```bash
# Ask about GDPR compliance
juro ask "Does my code comply with GDPR requirements?"

# Ask about security
juro ask "Are there any security vulnerabilities in my code?"

# Ask about data handling
juro ask "How is user data being handled in my application?"
```

### 2. Specific Code Analysis

Ask questions about specific parts of your code:

```bash
# Ask about authentication
juro ask "Is my authentication system secure?"

# Ask about data storage
juro ask "How is personal data stored in my database?"

# Ask about API security
juro ask "Are my API endpoints secure against common attacks?"
```

### 3. Context-Aware Queries

Provide context to get more accurate answers:

```bash
# Ask with file context
juro ask "Does this authentication code comply with GDPR?" --context "src/auth.js"

# Ask with directory context
juro ask "Are there any privacy issues in my user management code?" --context "src/user/"

# Ask with specific concerns
juro ask "I'm concerned about data encryption in my payment processing code" --context "src/payment.js"
```

## Advanced AI Queries

### 1. Comparative Analysis

Compare different approaches or implementations:

```bash
# Compare authentication methods
juro ask "Which authentication method is more secure: JWT or session-based?"

# Compare data storage approaches
juro ask "Should I use localStorage or encrypted storage for user preferences?"

# Compare encryption methods
juro ask "What's the difference between AES-256 and bcrypt for data encryption?"
```

### 2. Compliance Gap Analysis

Identify gaps in your compliance implementation:

```bash
# GDPR gap analysis
juro ask "What GDPR requirements am I missing in my current implementation?"

# SOC2 gap analysis
juro ask "What SOC2 controls do I need to implement for my application?"

# Security gap analysis
juro ask "What security measures am I missing to protect user data?"
```

### 3. Implementation Guidance

## Using AI Queries in Different Contexts

### 1. Development Workflow

Integrate AI queries into your development process:

```bash
# Before committing code
juro ask "Are there any compliance issues in my recent changes?" --context "src/"

# During code review
juro ask "Does this pull request introduce any security vulnerabilities?"

# When adding new features
juro ask "How should I implement this feature to be compliant with GDPR?"
```

### 2. Code Review Process

Use AI queries to enhance code reviews:

```bash
# Review specific files
juro ask "Review this authentication code for security issues" --context "src/auth.js"

# Review specific functions
juro ask "Is this data processing function compliant with privacy regulations?" --context "src/data.js:processUserData"

# Review entire modules
juro ask "What compliance issues exist in my user management module?" --context "src/user/"
```

### 3. Compliance Audits

Use AI queries for comprehensive compliance audits:

```bash
# Full compliance audit
juro ask "Perform a comprehensive compliance audit of my application"

# Specific regulation audit
juro ask "Audit my application for GDPR compliance requirements"

# Security audit
juro ask "Conduct a security audit of my application"
```

## Advanced Query Techniques

### 1. Multi-Part Questions

Ask complex questions that require analysis of multiple aspects:

```bash
# Comprehensive analysis
juro ask "Analyze my application for GDPR compliance, focusing on data collection, storage, and user rights"

# Security and compliance
juro ask "Evaluate both security and compliance aspects of my user authentication system"

# Performance and compliance
juro ask "Assess the performance and compliance implications of my data processing approach"
```

### 2. Scenario-Based Questions

Ask questions about specific scenarios:

```bash
# Data breach scenario
juro ask "How would my application handle a data breach scenario?"

# User consent withdrawal
juro ask "What happens when a user withdraws consent for data processing?"

# Regulatory changes
juro ask "How would new privacy regulations affect my current implementation?"
```

### 3. Comparative Analysis

Compare different approaches or implementations:

```bash
# Compare implementations
juro ask "Compare the security of my current authentication vs OAuth2 implementation"

# Compare frameworks
juro ask "What are the compliance implications of using React vs Vue for my frontend?"

# Compare databases
juro ask "Which database is more secure for storing user data: PostgreSQL or MongoDB?"
```

## Query Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

```bash
# Good: Specific question
juro ask "Does my password hashing implementation use bcrypt with proper salt rounds?"

# Avoid: Vague question
juro ask "Is my code secure?"
```

### 2. Provide Context

```bash
# Good: With context
juro ask "Does my user registration form comply with GDPR?" --context "src/auth/register.js"

# Avoid: Without context
juro ask "Does my form comply with GDPR?"
```

### 3. Ask Follow-up Questions

```bash
# Initial question
juro ask "Are there any security issues in my authentication code?"

# Follow-up question
juro ask "How can I fix the password storage issues you identified?"

# Further clarification
juro ask "What specific bcrypt configuration should I use for password hashing?"
```

### 4. Use Iterative Approach

```bash
# Start broad
juro ask "What compliance issues exist in my application?"

# Get specific
juro ask "How can I fix the GDPR data minimization violations?"

# Get implementation details
juro ask "Show me how to implement proper data minimization in my user registration form"
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### 1. IDE Integration

Use AI queries directly in your IDE:

```bash
# VS Code integration
juro ask "Analyze this function for security issues" --context "src/auth.js:validateUser"

# IntelliJ integration
juro ask "Review this class for compliance issues" --context "src/user/UserManager.java"
```

### 2. CI/CD Integration

Integrate AI queries into your continuous integration:

```bash
# Pre-commit hook
juro ask "Are there any compliance issues in my staged changes?"

# Pull request analysis
juro ask "Does this pull request introduce any security vulnerabilities?"

# Deployment check
juro ask "Is my application ready for production from a compliance perspective?"
```

### 3. Documentation Generation

Use AI queries to generate compliance documentation:

```bash
# Generate compliance report
juro ask "Generate a compliance report for my application"

# Create security documentation
juro ask "Create security documentation for my authentication system"

# Generate privacy policy
juro ask "Help me create a privacy policy based on my data handling practices"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Vague or unclear answers**
   - Be more specific in your questions
   - Provide more context
   - Ask follow-up questions

2. **No response or error**
   - Check your API key configuration
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Try with a simpler question

3. **Inaccurate answers**
   - Provide more context about your specific use case
   - Ask more specific questions
   - Use iterative questioning approach

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see detailed information:

```bash
juro ask "Analyze my code for security issues" --debug
```

This will show:
- Query processing steps
- Context analysis
- Response generation
- Performance metrics

## Best Practices

### 1. **Start Simple**
Begin with basic questions and gradually increase complexity:

```bash
# Start with basic question
juro ask "Is my code secure?"

# Add context
juro ask "Is my authentication code secure?" --context "src/auth.js"

# Get specific
juro ask "Are there any password storage vulnerabilities in my authentication code?" --context "src/auth.js"
```

### 2. **Use Iterative Approach**
Build understanding through multiple questions:

```bash
# Initial assessment
juro ask "What compliance issues exist in my application?"

# Focus on specific areas
juro ask "How can I fix the GDPR violations in my user data handling?"

# Get implementation details
juro ask "Show me how to implement proper data encryption for user data"
```

### 3. **Combine with Scanning**
Use AI queries to complement scanning results:

```bash
# First scan for violations
juro scan --path ./src --rules gdpr

# Then ask AI about specific issues
juro ask "How can I fix the data minimization violations found in my scan?"
```
